# CPSC 222 Final Project | Quantified Self

In this project, I've downloaded my Netflix viewing history & merged it with a days of week table to compute some interesting stats and create unique
visualizations. Further, I also performed some basic machine learning using kNN & decision tree classifiers to attempt to predict attributes for unseen 
instances in my dataset. 

This repository contains the .csv data files I worked with, a .py file for utility code, and a .ipynb file which is the main portion of this project. 
I hope you enjoy exploring my work in this project, and find some parts of it interesting along the way. 

Thanks, 
Matt
